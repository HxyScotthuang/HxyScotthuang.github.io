Hi there! Welcome to the personal website of Xingyue Huang (黄星越)! I am a DPhil in Computer Science studying in University of Oxford under supervision of [Professor Michael M. Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/) and [Dr. İsmail İlkan Ceylan](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/ismaililkan.ceylan/).  Previously, I obtained my undergraduate master degree on Mathematics and Computer Science from University of Oxford with Distinction. 

My main research interest is largely focused on **Graph Representation Learning**, **Knowledge graphs/hypergraphs**, and **Knowledge representaiton learning**. I am also interested in **Geometric Deep Learning**, and **Deep Learning** in general.

Before I got into graph learning, I had been working on **Evolutionary Algorithms** and **Genetic Programming** with grateful support from [Dr. Yu Zhou](https://yzhouszu.github.io/) in Shenzhen University.
