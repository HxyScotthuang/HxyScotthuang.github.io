excerpt: "Traditional query answering over knowledge graphs -- or broadly over relational data -- is one of the most fundamental problems in data management. Motivated by the incompleteness of modern knowledge graphs, a new setup for query answering has emerged, where the goal is to predict answers that do not necessarily appear in the knowledge graph, but are present in its completion. In this work, we propose AnyCQ, a graph neural network model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph, following training. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network model trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Our approach and problem setup differ from existing query answering studies in multiple dimensions. First, we focus on the problem of query answer classification: given a query and a set of possible answers, classify these proposals as true or false relative to the complete knowledge graph. Second, we study the problem of query answer retrieval: given a query, retrieve an answer to the query relative to the complete knowledge graph or decide that no correct solutions exist. Trained on simple, small instances, AnyCQ can generalize to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to samples where existing approaches fail, which is empirically validated on new and challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our AnyCQ models effectively transfer to out-of-distribution knowledge graphs, when equipped with a relevant link predictor, highlighting their potential to serve as a general engine for query answering."
