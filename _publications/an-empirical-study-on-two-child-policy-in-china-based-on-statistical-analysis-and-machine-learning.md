excerpt: 'Since the universal two-child policy (TCP) in China is launched in 2016, many researchers have dedicated their efforts into investigating the influences from the society point of view. In this paper, we look at this issue from a different angle, trying to investigate how the factors influence whether an expectant mother would bore a second child in China empirically. The real-world data from both rural and city regions are used to train an imbalance classification model. In addition, some statistical hypotheses are also made to justify the relevance of these factors. Experimental results demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our trained model.'
